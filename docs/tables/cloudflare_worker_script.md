# Table: cloudflare_worker_script - Query Cloudflare Worker Scripts using SQL

Worker Scripts host custom serverless code executed at Cloudflareâ€™s edge for enhanced logic, routing, and performance optimizations. They may include assets, modules, and optionally support logging via Logpush.

## Table Usage Guide

The `cloudflare_worker_script` table provides insights into metadata for Workers deployed per account within Cloudflare. As a security administrator or DevOps engineer, you can inspect script ID, creation and last modification timestamps, usage model, boolean flags for assets, modules and logpush enablement, JSON representing workers.dev subdomain mappings, list of log tail consumers, and placement configurations. Use it to audit Worker deployments, verify logging settings, monitor asset/module usage, check subdomain exposure, and review placement strategies across accounts.


## Examples

### Query all worker scripts
Retrieves all Worker scripts for all accounts. Worker scripts are lightweight JavaScript applications that run on Cloudflare's network to customize and enhance website functionality.

```sql+postgres
select
  ws.id,
  ws.account_id,
  ws.created_on,
  ws.modified_on,
  ws.usage_model,
  ws.has_assets,
  ws.has_modules,
  ws.logpush,
  a.name as account_name
from
  cloudflare_worker_script ws
join
  cloudflare_account a
on
  ws.account_id = a.id;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  ws.id,
  ws.account_id,
  ws.created_on,
  ws.modified_on,
  ws.usage_model,
  ws.has_assets,
  ws.has_modules,
  ws.logpush,
  a.name as account_name
from
  cloudflare_worker_script ws
join
  cloudflare_account a
on
  ws.account_id = a.id;
```

### Query all worker scripts with worker.dev subdomain available
Retrieves all Worker scripts where the worker.dev subdomain is enabled. The worker.dev subdomain provides an automatic subdomain for developers to test and deploy Worker scripts in a staging or development environment.

```sql+postgres
select
  ws.id,
  ws.account_id,
  ws.subdomain,
  a.name as account_name
from
  cloudflare_worker_script ws
join
  cloudflare_account a
on
  ws.account_id = a.id
where
  ws.subdomain ->> 'enabled' = 'true';
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  ws.id,
  ws.account_id,
  ws.subdomain,
  a.name as account_name
from
  cloudflare_worker_script ws
join
  cloudflare_account a
on
  ws.account_id = a.id
where
  ws.subdomain ->> 'enabled' = 'true';
```

### Query all worker scripts which have modules or assets
Retrieves all Worker scripts that have assets or modules enabled. Assets include additional resources (e.g., images, fonts, WASM files), while modules refer to modern JavaScript module syntax (e.g., ES Modules).

```sql+postgres
select
  ws.id,
  ws.has_assets,
  ws.has_modules,
  a.name as account_name
from
  cloudflare_worker_script ws
join
  cloudflare_account a
on
  ws.account_id = a.id
where
  ws.has_assets = true or ws.has_modules = true;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  ws.id,
  ws.has_assets,
  ws.has_modules,
  a.name as account_name
from
  cloudflare_worker_script ws
join
  cloudflare_account a
on
  ws.account_id = a.id
where
  ws.has_assets = true or ws.has_modules = true;
```
